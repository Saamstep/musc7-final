## Sushi
### California Roll

<font size="6">
I chose to eat sushi for this project! The sushi was freshly prepared and I ate it at home since it was from a grocery store. It was really good on a hot summer day and it still amazes me how raw or cold fish can still taste so good with such simple ingredients surrounding it. This dish specifically had just crab, rice, seaweed paper formally called nori, and avocado. Dipping it in some soy sauce with wasabi added a really nice salty-spicy note to the flavor.
