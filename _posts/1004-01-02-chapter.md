## About
### Grimes - 'Visions'

<font size="6">
The album ‘Visions’ by artist ‘Grimes’ that features twelve songs in total has a lot of Japanese influence throughout. This album mixes in a lot of modern day and traditional Japanese musical influences. ‘Be a Body’ (#8) specifically includes modern trends of ‘kawaii’ high pitched lyrics. Older influence can be seen through the use of percussion instruments and string instruments in the background of the song. We also see a reference to ‘侘寂’ or ‘wabi-sabi’ which is the idea of acceptance and transience. The inclusion of the ‘synth music’ I thought was a really nice modern, western addition to the Japanese influence. Many describe this type of style as ‘Japanese futurism’. Much like the traditional Japanese songs we also see that this song starts out slow and simple and ramps up.
