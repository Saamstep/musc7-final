## Cultural Appropriation?

<font size="6">
Overall, I see that this album and song in particular has utilized influences well and provided proper credit. Throughout the album Grimes has credited Japanese creatives such as Yayoi Kusama, Geinoh Yamashirogumi, Akira the film, the video game The Legends of Zelda, and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu as her muse behind the album. The only issue of cultural appropriation I could see is the album art including some Japanese wording that has no meaning, but seems to be there to make the album art look cool. I think giving a meaning behind the text is important even if most people do not understand the language as it shows respect for the language.
