### Grimes - 'Visions'

<font size="6">
Older influence can be seen through the use of percussion instruments and string instruments in the background of the song. We also see a reference to ‘侘寂’ or ‘wabi-sabi’ which is the idea of acceptance and transience. The inclusion of the ‘synth music’ I thought was a really nice modern, western addition to the Japanese influence. Many describe this type of style as ‘Japanese futurism’. Much like the traditional Japanese songs we also see that this song starts out slow and simple and ramps up.
