## Theater


#### Translation
* Noh, meaning skill or talent is simple dance-drama. Kabuki is a more classical/traditional form of theater.


#### Background
<font size="6">
* Noh performances are simple dance-dramas with a small team of actors, facemasks, simple dance movement, and lyrics are sung by a choir. Music is played by a nohkan flute and 3 drummers. Kabuki is predominately male dancing and singing with elaborate costumes and dance styles. This is more of a spinoff of Noh.
