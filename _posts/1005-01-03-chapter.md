## Sushi
### Connection to Music

<font size="6">
Overall, the fact that Japanese food can utilize simple ingredients to create complex flavors and spice levels together is really amazing. Sushi making is not easy and thus it reminds me of their traditional music and how musicians perfect their ability to play traditional instruments just like great sushi chefs become masters of creating sushi.
