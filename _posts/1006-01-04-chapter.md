### Personal Statement

<font size="6">
This has taught me that Japanese culture is one that can be very simple or complex in its values and culture. Their music is also one that can be very complex or simple as they have adapted many Chinese instruments to fit their purpose and create their own, unique styles. I do appreciate the time and effort that these artists put into perfecting their skills from chefs to artists it is not easy and is a true art form. I also find it amazing how western ideas can be combined with some of the newer and older Japanese musical traditions to create unique pieces as Grimes has produced. Overall this project got me listening to music more to appreciate all the different aspects of it.
