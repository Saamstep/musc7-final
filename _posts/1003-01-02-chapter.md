## Folk (min'yō)

**Translation** Min'yō is a compound word meaning ‘folk’ ‘song’.


**Background** Used during the 6th to 8th century for Shinto rituals and ceremonies where there was song and dance. Originally they were sung without instruments, later on shamisen, shakuhachi, shinobue, and other percussion instruments were utilized. Overtime this music form became popular in higher society and became merged with popular court music.

**Song Analysis** Very peaceful and soothing with a vocalist, very very slow BPM. Reminiscent almost of yoga style music at the start. Steps up with more vocalists and singers as if a folk ritual was taking place as the song progresses.
